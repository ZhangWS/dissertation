# Code Repository for "Political Implications of Bilingual Cognition"
*Dissertation submitted in partial fulfillment for a PhD in Political Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2018*

Rather hilariously, despite my interest in agent-based modeling (see GitHub repositories for conference papers featuring toy models) and machine learning (GitHub repositories forthcoming for personal and classroom projects), the research design for my dissertation ended up consisting of a series of survey experiments. 

The survey sample was a convenience sample of bilingual Chinese university students. The sample was convenient because I had limited access to a subset of university departments that would allow for the survey to be conducted.  Within each department, however, the treatment was randomly assigned.

The combination of these factors effectively meant that my analysis consisted of a series of between-group analyses (in business terms, A/B testing). Though not methodologically sexy, I presented careful analyses of my experimental data and present convincing visualizations to complement my narrative. 

Techniques used in my dissertation included data entry, data cleaning, and data exploration; data visualization with ggplot; lots and lots of two-way ANOVA, Chi-square tests, Fisher's Exact Test (and all the post hoc tests); ordered logit regression; ordinary least squares regression; Factor Analysis (Chapter 3) and Principle Component Analysis (Chapter 3).
