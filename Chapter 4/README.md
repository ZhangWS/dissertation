# Chapter 4

Chapter 4 examined cultural frame shifting, in which speaking one language versus the other activated concepts and attitudes that were more closely associated with one language environment (which can be culture but need not be) versus another, either through immersion or through osmosis. 

In the first section, respondents were asked to answer several batteries of attitudinal questions with answers that are commonly characterized as dividing East Asian cultures with Western ones, including orientation towards authority and collectivism. The second section examines whether judgment may be affected with regard to assessing whether a country is democratic or not.

Again, most of this chapter used statistical tests discussed in Chapter 2, but I did get to use factor analysis and PCA (which was pretty silly on a sample size of 450!) to investigate how observed response variances on batteries reflected actual variances in unobserved variable(s). In addition, I used linear regression and ordered logistic regression as checks. 

Interestingly, while responses from female subjects differed with regard to the number of underlying factors (2 in Chinese, 1 in English), responses from male subjects only seemed to load onto one factor regardless of language.
