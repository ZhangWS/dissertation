# Chapter 3

Chapter 3 examined language specificity effect with regard to memory. Psychologists have found that bilinguals are more likely to retrieve memories when speaking the language in which they had had the experiences.

Though this was a straightforward setup, I ended up pulling the data apart in multiple different ways to interrogate whether variations in the language, gender, respondent population, etc, affected responses. In the end, it was a hilarous amount of work for a null result, but given the structure of the experiment, I think I can confidently say that language by itself probably (ha) does not affect memory retrieval.
