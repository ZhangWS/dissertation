# Chapter 2

The first substantive chapter examined the relationship between language, affect, and decision-making. The three concepts that I investigated were the framing effect (with regard to risk), loss aversion, and perception of fairness. The code here has been divided up by subsection.

Two experiments were survey replications of experiments (conducted in a laboratory setting) by Keysar, Hayakawa, and An (2012), while the Prisoner's Dilemma experiment was an original design that tried to work with the limitations of a survey setting.

Though the analysis was fairly simple (mostly AB testing with a lot of parametric and non parametric testing), it was the longest chapter in the book and also took the longest to write.
